/**
 * An annotation that indicates the version number until a member or a type should be present.
 * Basically, if Gson is created with a version number that exceeds the value stored in the
 * {@code Until} annotation then the field will be ignored from the JSON output.  This annotation
 * is useful to manage versioning of your JSON classes for a web-service.
 *
 * <p>
 * This annotation has no effect unless you build {@link com.google.gson.Gson} with a
 * {@link com.google.gson.GsonBuilder} and invoke
 * {@link com.google.gson.GsonBuilder#setVersion(double)} method.
 *
 * <p>Here is an example of how this annotation is meant to be used:</p>
 * <pre>
 * public class User {
 *   private String firstName;
 *   private String lastName;
 *   &#64Until(1.1) private String emailAddress;
 *   &#64Until(1.1) private String password;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>If you created Gson with {@code new Gson()}, the {@code toJson()} and {@code fromJson()}
 * methods will use all the fields for serialization and deserialization. However, if you created
 * Gson with {@code Gson gson = new GsonBuilder().setVersion(1.2).create()} then the
 * {@code toJson()} and {@code fromJson()} methods of Gson will exclude the {@code emailAddress}
 * and {@code password} fields from the example above, because the version number passed to the 
 * GsonBuilder, {@code 1.2}, exceeds the version number set on the {@code Until} annotation,
 * {@code 1.1}, for those fields.
