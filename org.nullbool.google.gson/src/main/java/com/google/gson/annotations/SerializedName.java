/**
 * An annotation that indicates this member should be serialized to JSON with
 * the provided name value as its field name.
 *
 * <p>This annotation will override any {@link com.google.gson.FieldNamingPolicy}, including
 * the default field naming policy, that may have been set on the {@link com.google.gson.Gson}
 * instance.  A different naming policy can set using the {@code GsonBuilder} class.  See
 * {@link com.google.gson.GsonBuilder#setFieldNamingPolicy(com.google.gson.FieldNamingPolicy)}
 * for more information.</p>
 *
 * <p>Here is an example of how this annotation is meant to be used:</p>
 * <pre>
 * public class SomeClassWithFields {
 *   &#64SerializedName("name") private final String someField;
 *   private final String someOtherField;
 *
 *   public SomeClassWithFields(String a, String b) {
 *     this.someField = a;
 *     this.someOtherField = b;
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The following shows the output that is generated when serializing an instance of the
 * above example class:</p>
 * <pre>
 * SomeClassWithFields objectToSerialize = new SomeClassWithFields("a", "b");
 * Gson gson = new Gson();
 * String jsonRepresentation = gson.toJson(objectToSerialize);
 * System.out.println(jsonRepresentation);
 *
 * ===== OUTPUT =====
 * {"name":"a","someOtherField":"b"}
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>NOTE: The value you specify in this annotation must be a valid JSON field name.</p>
